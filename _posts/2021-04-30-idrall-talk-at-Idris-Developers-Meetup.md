I gave a talk about my Dhall implementation [Idrall](https://github.com/alexhumphreys/idrall) at the [Idris Developers Meetup 2021](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Idris-Developers-Meeting,-April-2021). Big thanks to the organisers for the event, it was really fun! And shout out to Andre for helping me sort out this recording.

The talk is a brief intro to Dhall and why I'm using it, and a status update on how my implementation is going. So if that's of interest to you, or you just want to see what I've been up to while stuck indoors for the pandemic, check it out!
