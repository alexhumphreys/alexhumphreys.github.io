# Language resources

Some links I've been playing around with to learn how to create programming languages:

- [A simple interpreter from scratch in python](http://www.jayconrod.com/posts/40/a-simple-interpreter-from-scratch-in-python-part-4)
- [Writing your own programming language and compiler with python](https://blog.usejournal.com/writing-your-own-programming-language-and-compiler-with-python-a468970ae6df)
- [Paper: Monadic Parser Combinators](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/monparsing.pdf), good intro to parser combinators and monads
- [Good short ruby implementation](https://gist.github.com/zacharyvoase/271792) of the aforementioned Monadic Paser Combinators [paper](https://gist.github.com/zacharyvoase/271792).
- [Easy introduction to what lambda calculus is](https://palmstroem.blogspot.com/2012/05/lambda-calculus-for-absolute-dummies.html)

And a big list of resources somebody else conveniently made:
