# Language resources

Some links I've been playing around with to learn how to create programming languages:

- [A simple interpreter from scratch in python](http://www.jayconrod.com/posts/40/a-simple-interpreter-from-scratch-in-python-part-4)
- [Writing your own programming language and compiler with python](https://blog.usejournal.com/writing-your-own-programming-language-and-compiler-with-python-a468970ae6df)

And a big list of resources somebody else conveniently made:

[68 Resources To Help You To Create Programming Languages](https://tomassetti.me/resources-create-programming-languages/)
